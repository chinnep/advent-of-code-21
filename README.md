### Log

1. Day 1
    1. Part 1 is missing, but this is day 1 so it's pretty straightforward
2. Day 2
    1. Both parts are present
    2. Nothing crazy algorithm-wise
2. Day 3
    1. Created an array of the sums of each digit per placement (sum of all digits in the 1s place, etc...). We then compute the average of the digits per placement and since its a binary we can assume anything below 0.5 has 0 as the most common number and anything above has 1 as the most common. Since there was no mention of there being a tie in the directions we can assume that there is an absolute answer. 
    2. Nothing crazy algorithm-wise
